MintCoin 2.0 Proposed Revisions
------

The following is a list of revisions proposed for the MintCoin 2.0 branch. While development and testing of the
overhauled 2.1 client continue, there are aspects of the current release version that need some work.

Please note that this list is not in any way meant to be seen as a commitment for implementation. Developers
are working on a volunteer basis in their personal free time. If you would like to contribute to these, or
any other, improvements contact the MINT Team via any of the below resources.

### For Immediate Consideration: ###

##### UI / Qt Revisions: #####
1. **Removal of the webview panes**. These panes have been in their default state ever since the
mintcoinofficial.com domain was obtained by the MINT Team from Cryptomommy. The links are mostly out-of-date
and the switching functionality no longer works.

2. **Improved Coin Control Features**. The information displayed in the Coin Control window seems rather lackluster
right now, and could be improved upon to include more relevant information for a PoS coin. Additional information
to include Age, Weight, Estimated Minting.

3. **Improved RecurringSend Documentation**. RecurringSend is a feature that allows a person to setup recurring
transactions. While the feature works as intended when Coin Control is disabled, RecurringSend and Coin Control are mutually
exclusive features. When Coin Control is enabled, the RecurringSend pane appears blank. The proposed change
is to add in-pane explanation of this in the RecurringSend pane when Coin Control is enabled.

##### Core / BackEnd Revisions: #####
1. **Conditioned Network Messages**. With the upcoming 2.1 overhauled client, special conditioning and consideration
needs to be made for HDF syncing to work efficiently. Specific changes are yet to be determined as testing is still
ongoing. However, due to the differences in block/data request methods, changes will be backwards compatible with
current clients.

2. **Flesh Out Old Seeds**. Over time, some of the seeder addresses included in the source have become stale and
non-functional. While this is not a detriment to client functionality, it is also not necessary to keep including
these addresses.


### For Future Consideration: ###

##### UI / Qt Revisions: #####
1. **StakeSend/MultiStake**. While RecurringSend is good for those that would like to setup static recurring
transactions based on a time interval (and who don't use Coin Control), the ability to send a portion of
one's mintings to alternate address(es) provides a more robust infrastructure for donations.

2. **Visual Redesign**. The current UI design is looking very antiquated right now. Rightly so as it is almost
3 years old. A redesign has been on our radar for quite some time, and has unfortunately taken a back seat
to the important core overhaul that has been ongoing.

3. **Input Split/Combine**. Management of a large number of inputs is tedious over a long period of time.
As inputs are minted, they are split in half (unless they fall below the staketime threshold) which eventually
results in the need to recombine inputs to maintain a reasonable minting time post-maturity. This feature
makes the process much less time consuming, at the cost of a higher transaction fee.

##### Core / BackEnd Revisions: #####
1. **StakeSplitThreshold**. Allow users to set a coin-value threshold for splitting an input upon minting.
This will reduce the need to manually recombine resulting low-value inputs from the splitting that occurs
when an input mints.
