MintCoin Public TestNet
------

Greetings and salutations Minters! First off, We would like to wish everyone a Happy New Year and hope that your first month of 2017 has been a good one. Now that the proverbial "dust" from the holidays has settled, we would like to invite anyone and everyone to join us in testing our two upcoming wallet releases (thats right, TWO!)

##### MintCoin Wallet v2.0.3 #####
First off, we have a release candidate for v2.0.3 that addresses some minor issues with network sync stalling. We've also cleaned up some of the now defunct UI elements (namely QtWebView) as they were archaic and never really looked quite right. This version will serve as one of, if not THE, last releases along the 2.0.x chain.

The purpose of this release is to serve as the final intermediary between 2.0.x and 2.1.x, with special considerations for how network messages and syncing is handled.

##### MintCoin Wallet v2.1.0 #####
Secondly, there is our v2.1.0 wallet that has been worked on in length over the past year. While details of exactly what this release would entail have been sparse, mainly due to not wanting to spread unnecessary hype, we have reached the point of inevitability.

This version's primary purpose is to bring the core MINT codebase to a more current state. Its no secret that the existing codebase is sorely outdated, being primarily a fork from Bitcoin 0.7.2 with a little bit of Bitcoin 0.8.0 tossed in here n' there.

TestNet Phases
------

The public TestNet will consist of two primary phases aimed at assisting in the completion of v2.1.0:

##### Phase One #####
**Start Date:** Jan 31 2017
**End Date:** TBA
**Target Version:** 2.0.3

While the MintCoin Team members have already spent time building the TestNet chain during internal testings, we need the public's help to add more stress to the network.

To this end, we will be releasing multi-platform pre-compiled binaries of the v2.0.3-RC that are locked in TestNet mode, they will not connect to the main MintCoin network nor will they interfere with existing wallet data.

Testers are asked to add transaction stress to the network in the form of sending coins amongst one another. See below for information on TestNet coin distribution methods.

##### Phase Two #####
**Start Date:** TBA
**End Date:** TBA
**Target Version:** 2.1.0

The second phase of our public test involves monitoring the data upgrade and network syncing process for the v2.1.0 client. The move to a more recent codebase includes a reorganization of the wallet's data directory as well as fundamental changes to how network syncing is handled.

Again, we will be releasing multi-platform pre-compiled binaries of the v2.1.0 test client that are locked in TestNet mode. They will not connect to the main MintCoin network or interfere with existing MainNet wallet data.

For the purpose of this test, testers that participated in phase one will be asked to backup their existing TestNet data directory (without removing/renaming it) and run the v2.1.0 wallet client.

Testers that did NOT participate in phase one simply need to run the v2.1.0 wallet client.
