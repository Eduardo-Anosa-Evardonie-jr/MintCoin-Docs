### OPTIONAL UPDATE - v2.0.1.0

This patch is intended to be the last release of the 2.0 branch and the "beginning of the end" for the old and outdated single-file blockchain database structure. Before the next major version however, we wanted to make some of the network/message/cpu optimizations available. Some of the changes included in this release are:

* Back ports from mainline bitcoin to improve message handling.
* Disable some mining code that is no longer used during the pure proof-of-stake phase.
* Bloom filter feature added to increase privacy.
* Many small network optimizations.

The biggest benefit is much lower CPU usage and bandwidth used. While memory consumption still remains on the "high" side, a few memory leaks were fixed that will prevent a situation of exponential memory usage increase from occurring when the wallet is left open over extended periods of time.

### HOW TO UPDATE

Since this release still runs on the single-file database format, updating is a simple process of replacing your binary executable. Please make sure that no MintCoin processes are currently running before replacing this file! Once the file has been replaced, start up your wallet/daemon as usual.


All startup and RPC commands from previous versions, as well as conf file format remain the same.
All Images, Logos, and GUI elements remain consistent with previous 2.0 branch releases.
