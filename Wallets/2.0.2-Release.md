### RECOMMENDED  UPDATE - v2.0.2

This is a security and maintenance patch for the 2.0 branch of MintCoin. As work towards the 2.1 overhaul is being extended, we are continuing to make adjustments and forward compatibility patches to our current release branch (2.0). Included in this release are a number of updates related to security. Though mostly edge cases, we feel it is important to include such patches for completeness.

### SUPPORT FOR 3RD PARTY TRANSACTION URLS

Included in this release is optional support for 3rd party transaction URLs (Block explorer links). The setting is accessed from within the GUI's options window in the "Display" tab. Users can enter URLs to as many Block Explorers Transaction pages as they like and each entry (after restarting the client) will then be a clickable item in the transaction history's context menu.

This eliminates the need to manually copy/paste a TXID into a block explorer's search field. Some example URLs to include in this field are:
```

https://www.cryptopia.co.nz/BlockExplorer?id=240&txId=%s
```

### HOW TO UPDATE

Since this release still runs on the single-file database format, updating is a simple process of replacing your binary executable from one of the downloads below. Please make sure that no MintCoin processes are currently running before replacing this file! Once the file has been replaced, start up your wallet/daemon as usual.

##### WINDOWS INSTALLER RETURNS

Windows clients now again have the option of using a self-contained installer (available below) to install MintCoin on their systems. The installer places the binaries in your Program Files folder and adds a handy Start Menu Icon for easy launching.


All startup and RPC commands from previous versions, as well as conf file format remain the same.
All Images, Logos, and GUI elements remain consistent with previous 2.0 branch releases.
